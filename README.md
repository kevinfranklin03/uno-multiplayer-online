# UNO-MULTIPLAYER-ONLINE (8BIT THEME)

My first serious web development project. It is a two players clicked-based online game that uses WebSockets protocol, for full duplex communication between the client and the server. This is an online version of the game called ‚ÄôUNO‚Äô.
## ‚ùì About the Game

This two-player online version of the game was built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). It currently supports two-players in each game. It also has text chat functionality to communicate with your opponent!

## üßê How to Play?

1. Once you're on the homepage of the game, you can either host a new game or join a friend's game.
2. To host a new game, click on CREATE GAME. A game code will be generated which you can share with your friend.
3. To join a friend's game, enter the game code given by them, and click on JOIN GAME.
4. That's it! Enjoy the game and remember, no toxicity!

**For Running:**

### ‚è≥ Installation

- At the root of the project directory, use npm to install the server-side dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This command installs all the server-side dependencies needed for the game to run locally.

- Use npm to run server

```bash
npm start
```

This command gets the server running on localhost port 5000.

- In a separate terminal, navigate into the client folder and use npm to install the client-side dependencies

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

This command installs all the client-side dependencies needed for the game to run locally.

- Finally, use npm to run client

```bash
npm start
```

This command gets the client running on localhost port 3000.

Head over to http://localhost:3000/ and enjoy the game! üéâ
