# UNO-MULTIPLAYER-ONLINE (8BIT THEME)

My first serious web development project. It is a two players clicked-based online game that uses WebSockets protocol, for full duplex communication between the client and the server. This is an online version of the game called ’UNO’.
## ❓ About the Game

This two-player online version of the game was built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). It currently supports two-players in each game. It also has text chat functionality to communicate with your opponent!

## 🧐 How to Play?

1. Once you're on the homepage of the game, you can either host a new game or join a friend's game.
2. To host a new game, click on CREATE GAME. A game code will be generated which you can share with your friend.
3. To join a friend's game, enter the game code given by them, and click on JOIN GAME.
4. That's it! Enjoy the game and remember, no toxicity!
